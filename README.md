# EDIROL V-4/V-8 MIDI Dump Reverse Engineering
A project for reverse engineering the MIDI Bulk Dump of the EDIROL V-4 and V-8 series of video mixers to allow for total control of all parameters of the mixer via sysex commands.

Any scripts or documentation or scripts that apply to both the EDIROL V-4 and V-8 will be in the root of their respective folders. Anything specific to either mixer will be in its respective subfolder. At the moment I only have a V-8 to test with. If anybody is willing to provide a V-4 dump, it will allow me to assess whether this separation is necessary.
